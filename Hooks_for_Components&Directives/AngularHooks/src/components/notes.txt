Order of the exectuion of the hooks

1) ngOnChanges
2) ngOnInit
3) ngDoCheck
4) ngAfterContentInit
5) ngAfterContentChecked
6) ngAfterViewInit
7) ngAfterViewChecked
8) ngOnDestroy


1)ngOnChanges is called before the ngOnInit whenever the chages are sent through Input variable from the 
Parent comp to child Comp

2) Even if there are n variable changed at the first time it will all show in the ngOnchanges but when
we need to remember it will show only the changed varaibles if it is less than n the second then 
it will show less than n variables in the Simple Changes object.

3)There is a difference between the ngOnChanges and ngDoCheck 
ngOnChanges detects the changes when inputs are passed by Value
ngDoCheck detects the changes when inputs are passed by Reference

// Note whenever the Init is in the hook it is called only once

4)ngAfterContentInit is called only once while intilazing the component . It's basic use it to 
intialize the variables in the ngOnInit and to call the functions which needs to be executed after 
intilazing of all the varaibles and the function to be executed after that and that too only once.

5) ngAfterContentChecked is the DoCheck version for OnInit as the Docheck occurs mutliple times while the
OnInit occurs only one while Intilazation this is also similar to it as the ngAfterContentInit occurs
only once in order to neutral that the angular team has introduced this ngAfterContentChecked hook
which occurs every time for a change

6) ngAfterViewInit occurs only once

7) ngAfterViewChecked occurs for all the changes opposite to ngAfterViewInit

8) There has been a example in the code to show how the subscriptions and data related to a 
component is destroyed in this method while removing some element from the DOM
