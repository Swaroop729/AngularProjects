1)ngOnChanges is called before the ngOnInit whenever the chages are sent through Input variable from the 
Parent comp to child Comp

2) Even if there are n variable changed at the first time it will all show in the ngOnchanges but when
we need to remember it will show only the changed varaibles if it is less than n the second then 
it will show less than n variables in the Simple Changes object.

3)There is a difference between the ngOnChanges and ngDoCheck 
ngOnChanges detects the changes when inputs are passed by Value
ngDoCheck detects the changes when inputs are passed by Reference
